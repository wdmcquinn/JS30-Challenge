# JavaScript30
I am participating in the Javascript 30 challenge by @wesbos. 30 projects in 30 days. Pure Javascript only.
My solutions to each problem can be found in the index.html files in each folder. I want to leave the original structure intact. 
Please join me in the challenge by checking out the link below.
